# Nervous About Investing in Cryptocurrency? 
---
"Of course I hate the success of Bitcoin. I don’t welcome a currency that’s so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth, nor do I like just shuffling out of your extra billions of billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air. I think I should say modestly that the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization,” *said Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger during a Q&A session at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in April of 2021.* 

## Overview and Origin
While my views do not align with Mr. Munger's, maybe some of his disdain is derived from the fact investing in cryptocurrency can be a daunting task. Coinbase Inc. co-Founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam worked to solve this problem in 2012 when they created their online platform that allows merchants, consumers, and traders to transact with digital currency.

Before starting Coinbase, Brian Armstrong worked for 14 months at Airbnb as a technical product manager focused on fraud prevention. During this time, he learned about payment systems across the world and their problems while he became interested in crytocoins. 

Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Coinbase boasts a team of 1,700 employees with sales of 1.3B USD, a market cap of 68.1B USD and it is the largest consumer bitcoin wallet in the world. The company supports 56 million global users and facilitates transactions in 190 countries. They have raised a total of $547.3M in funding over 14 rounds and their latest funding was raised on Oct 1, 2020.

## Business Activities

According to their mission, "Everyone deserves access to financial services that can help empower them to create a better life for themselves and their families. If the world economy ran on a common set of standards that could not be manipulated by any company or country, the world would be a more fair and free place, and human progress would accelerate."

Brian Armstrong told Forbes last year, “I wanted the world to have a global, open financial system that drove innovation and freedom." He elaborated on this matter in an earlier blog post when he stated, ”we believe that open protocols for money will create more innovation, economic freedom, and equality of opportunity in the world, just like the internet did for publishing information."

To achieve this, Coinbase began by providing a safe and regulatory-compliant crypto exchange, and once they succeeded there, they branched out to offer crypto custodial services to institutions, plus a personal wallet and new currencies designed to appeal to those seeking more privacy with the goal of becoming the most trusted name in the cryptocurrency space.
